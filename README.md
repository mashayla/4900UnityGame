3 levels - elevators arenâ€™t working
The door to the stairs is locked. The character needs a key to unlock the door to each staircase.

When the game begins, the player's character begins to wake up on the bed on the third floor of the hospital. We want to use timer to make the key to switch to a random location while going around the room on each floor, We also would like for the key to switch positions after a certain time of being unfound.

We also want to make hideable spaces, such as cabinets or under beds, make them hide through interaction, and set them up to prevent enemies from seeing if the player is in that position.

If there is a enemy near the player, the player's HP is constantly reduced, and to recover HP, the player must eat food items in a certain position.

In the end, the game begins at dusk and must escape before sunrise. If the player is caught by a enemy or fails to escape until sunrise, the character is permanently confined to the hospital.
